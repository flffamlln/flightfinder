## flightfinder
This web app uses the Skyscanner API (https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search) to show flight options given specific dates and locations. It allows users to choose their preferred currency and to view round-trip and one-way offers. After hitting search, flightfinder will highlight the cheapest flight available at that time. Users can also view flight options from low to high or high to low. This website was made as part of the Capital One Challenge on MindSumo.
